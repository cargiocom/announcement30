<h2>How to read Bitcoin charts?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin charts usually present the progress of the price using Japanese candlesticks. Each candle represents a specific time-frame (depends on the chart) and is showing the open, close, and price range during that time-frame. On top of that, the chart usually contains a variety of technical analysis indicators. The most popular are support and resistance levels, trend-lines, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Fibonacci retracement levels.</p>
<h2>Use the Сargio trading terminal for technical analysis:</h2>
<p>- A wide range of indicators and technical tools for market analysis.<br>
- Ability to perform technical analysis on different time intervals to identify patterns.</p>
<h2>What affects the price of Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Just like any other traded asset, the Bitcoin price is affected by supply and demand, as simple as that. However, the occurrence of certain global fundamental events could have a relation to the value of Bitcoin: During the year of 2016, for example, India's banknote demonetization had a positive effect on Bitcoin. In India, the price of the cryptocurrency was trading 20% higher than the rest of the world. If we go to recent years, the 2019 bull-run could be related to Facebook announcing on the Libra project. The bull-run started losing momentum as news regarding Libra's regulation's hardness started popping on the news. Besides the major global events, there are some Bitcoin heavy-bag holders, which are also known as Bitcoin Whales. They are holding thousands of BTC's, and that is enough to create large enough daily price maneuvers.</p>
